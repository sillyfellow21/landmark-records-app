# Academic Integrity Statement

This document outlines the use of AI tools in the development of the Landmark Records mobile application.

## 1. Tools Used

- **Google's Gemini Large Language Model:** Used as a development assistant for generating, refactoring, and debugging code within the IDE.

## 2. What Was Created by Me (The Student)

- The initial project problem statement and all high-level requirements.
- All manual tasks, including:
  - Running `flutter` commands in the terminal.
  - Creating the Git repository, branches, commits, and pull requests.
  - Creating wireframes, recording the demo video, and managing the final submission.
  - Supplying the local image assets.
- All iterative feedback, prompts, and final decisions on the application's design and functionality.

## 3. What Was AI-Generated and How It Was Modified

- **Boilerplate Code:** Gemini generated the initial boilerplate for all Dart files (`main.dart`, screen files, provider, etc.).

- **Code Implementation:** The core logic for the following features was generated by Gemini based on my prompts:
  - Setting up the bottom navigation bar.
  - Implementing the `LandmarkProvider` for state management.
  - Fetching and parsing data from the REST API.
  - Implementing the UI for the "Records" and "New Entry" screens.
  - Integrating and configuring the OpenStreetMap (`flutter_map`) widget, including markers and bottom sheets.

- **Refactoring and Debugging:** I used Gemini to:
  - Refactor the project from Google Maps to OpenStreetMap.
  - Implement the fallback logic for local asset images (`.jpg`/`.jpeg`).
  - Add the default landmark data when the API is empty.
  - Correct the `pubspec.yaml` SDK version conflict.

- **Documentation:** The `README.md` and this integrity statement were generated by Gemini based on our development history.

**My Role in Modification:** All AI-generated code was reviewed, understood, and integrated by me. I guided the entire development flow by providing specific instructions, requesting features, and identifying areas that needed correction or improvement. The final code is a result of a direct, prompt-driven collaboration with the AI assistant.
